This means there's no absolute frame of reference; motion is always relative.\n*   **The Constancy of the Speed of Light:** The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the light source. This seemingly simple postulate has profound implications.\n\n**General Relativity:**\n\n*   **The Equivalence Principle:** There is no way to distinguish locally between the effects of gravity and the effects of acceleration. This means that gravitational mass and inertial mass are equivalent.\n*   **Spacetime Curvature:** Gravity is not a force in the traditional sense, but rather a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime. Massive objects warp the fabric of spacetime around them, and other objects follow these curves, which we perceive as gravity.\n\nThese foundational principles led to revolutionary ideas such as time dilation, length contraction, the famous mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²), and a new understanding of gravity's influence on the universe.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":27}]}
